      "summary": "A female Slavic house spirit, often malevolent, who inhabits homes and engages in household mischief if the house is dirty or the family disrespectful. She helps if the house is kept clean.",
      "full": "The Kikimora is a female household spirit from Slavic folklore, particularly Russian traditions. Described as a small old woman, often hunched with chicken legs in some versions, she is considered the wife or counterpart of the Domovoi (male house spirit). The Kikimora's behavior depends entirely on the state of the household: in clean, well-kept homes with respectful families, she may be helpful, but in messy or discordant households, she becomes increasingly malicious. Her activities include tickling children at night, breaking dishes, tangling yarn, and making mysterious noises. She is rarely seen, heard more than seen, and often depicted as crooked or deformed."
