      "full": "The Kikimora is a female household spirit from Slavic folklore, particularly prominent in Russian traditions. Described as a small old woman, often hunched with chicken legs in some versions, she is considered the wife or counterpart of the Domovoi (male house spirit). The Kikimora's behavior depends entirely on the state of the household: in clean, well-kept homes with respectful families, she may be helpful, but in messy or discordant households, she becomes increasingly malicious. Her activities include tickling children at night, breaking dishes, tangling yarn, and making mysterious noises. She is rarely seen, heard more than seen, and often depicted as crooked or deformed. The Kikimora serves as a cautionary figure in Slavic folklore, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a clean, harmonious household and treating domestic spirits with respect."
